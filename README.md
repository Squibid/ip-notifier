# ip-notifier (WIP)
Tracks how your external ip changes.

The intended usecase is for a user to be able to know their external ip so that they have access to their server/machine from anywhere via SSH.
The time between checks can be changed in `config.txt` and is defined at the end of the first line in seconds (the default is 30min).
